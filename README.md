# Instagram Followers Extractor

Simple script for Chrome dev console which I used to get a JSON list of my Instagram followers.

Example output:

```
[
  {
    "tag":"iamrucka",
    "link":"https://instagram.com/iamrucka/"
  },
  {
    "tag":"shadowbreacker359",
    "link":"https://instagram.com/shadowbreacker359/"
  }
]
```
